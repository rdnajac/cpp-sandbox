Task Statement
Imagine a scenario where you are given two vectors of integers. Your task is to write a function that retrieves and returns pairs of integers. The first item of the pair will be from the first vector, while the second one will come from the second vector. It's crucial to remember that the first element must be less than the second.

The sequence of pairs in your output should align with the order they appear in the input vectors. For instance, given the vectors {1, 3, 7} and {2, 8, 9}, the function should return {{1, 2}, {1, 8}, {1, 9}, {3, 8}, {3, 9}, {7, 8}, {7, 9}}. It will pose a challenge if no pairs exist, or if any input vector is empty. Let's delve into this task step by step to uncover the solution!
