# C++ sandbox

A collection of C++ code snippets and examples.

## Projects

- TCP client/server
- `std::chrono`

## `docs/`

Made with [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
mkdocs serve
open http:localhost:8000
```
> [!NOTE] 
> Each subdirectory in this repository contains a `README.md` file that is
> symlinked to the `docs/` directory so that the markdown is compiled into
> an HTML page that can be viewed in a browser with the rest of the docs.

## Resources

There are a lot of cool guides and resources out there and I've compiled
the ones I've found most helpful here and included them as a submodules
in this repo so that they can be easily accessed and updated. The search
plugin that comes with the Material for MkDocs theme can be used to search
through all the resources at once, even if they're excluded from the nav.

I found this cool repo called
and I liked it so much, it's
built along with the rest of the docs.

### Columbia OS Dev Guide

I took an Operating Systems class at Columbia and the TA staff wrote some really
helpful guides that I found myself referring to a lot, even after graduating.
They're publicly available [here](https://columbia-os.github.io/dev-guides/),
but I'm unsure if this is the most up-to-date version.

#### Recitations

I've included the recitations from the class in the resources folder.
If someone from the CU CS departments finds this and wants me to take it down,
please let me know.

#### vim config

Special shoutout to [this page](https://columbia-os.github.io/dev-guides/vim-workflow.html)
that sent me down a years-long rabbit hole of vim plugins and configurations.
