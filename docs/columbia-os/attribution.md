# Columbia OS Dev Guide

I took an Operating Systems class at Columbia and the TA staff wrote some really
helpful guides that I found myself referring to a lot, even after graduating.
They're publicly available [here](https://columbia-os.github.io/dev-guides/),
but I'm unsure if this is the most up-to-date version.

## Recitations

I've included the recitations from the class in the resources folder.
If someone from the CU CS departments finds this and wants me to take it down,
please let me know.

## vim config

Special shoutout to [this page](https://columbia-os.github.io/dev-guides/vim-workflow.html)
that sent me down a years-long rabbit hole of vim plugins and configurations.
