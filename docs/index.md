# C++ Sandbox

Trying stuff out.

## Resources

I found this cool repo called [Modern C++ Features](https://github.com/AnthonyCalandra/modern-cpp-features)
and I liked it so much, it's included as a submodule in this repo so that gets
built along with the rest of the docs. Access it [here](vendor/modern-cpp-features/README.md).

When in doubt, check out the [C++ Reference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/).
